		<dt class="ques" id="dt-1"><a href="#"> What is the Difference between officers and enlisted service members?</a></dt>
		<dd class="invisible" id="dd-1">Officers are the managers of the Military, acting in leadership roles that require planning, directing operations and making critical decisions. Almost all officer positions require a four-year degree or equivalent education. Enlisted service members perform many jobs in the Military. While these occupations mostly involve hands-on training for mechanical, transportation, human service or office fields that transfer well to the civilian world, they also include infantry roles. A high school diploma is required to become an enlisted service member in the Military.</dd>

		<dt class="ques" id="dt-2"><a href="#">What is MEPS?</a></dt>
		<dd class="invisible"id="dd-2">Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) is a joint Service organization with locations all over the country, that determines an applicant's physical qualifications, aptitude and moral standards as set by each branch of military service. Visiting MEPS is an important step in becoming an enlisted service member.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt class="ques" id="dt-3"><a href="#">What happens during Basic training?</a></dt>
		<dd class="invisible"id="dd-3">Basic training, which is commonly known as boot camp, is a 8-to-13 week training program that prepares recruits for all elements of service: physical, mental and emotional. It also instills service members with discipline, confidence, and reinforces the importance of teamwork.</dd>

		<dt class="ques" id="dt-6"><a href="#">What is Pay like for military jobs?</a></dt>

		<br>
		<dt class="ques" id="dt-8"><a href="#">What is it like to live and work in the Military?</a></dt>
		<dd class="invisible"id="dd-8">As in the civilian world, military life varies depending on a service memberâ€™s job, attitude and desire. Once work or training is done for the day, however, a service member can do as he or she pleases. Visit Military Life for more information on free time, family support and military perks</dd>

		<dt class="ques" id="dt-9"><a href="#">How does deployment work in the Military?</a></dt>
		<dd class="invisible"id="dd-9">Generally, deployment means a scheduled time away from the normal duty station, usually outside of the United States. It may mean seven months on a Navy ship, 12 months at a forward operating base or three months in a town with restaurants and shops you'd recognize back home.</dd>
		<br>
		<dt class="ques" id="dt-10"><a href="#">Is deployment dangerous?</a></dt>
		<dd class="invisible"id="dd-10">In popular movies, books or other media, military deployments are usually characterized as being very dangerous, with troops heading off to war in a remote location. While this is a possible reality for some service members, not all deployments involve combat situations.</dd>
